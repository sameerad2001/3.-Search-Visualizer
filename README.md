# Search algorithm visualizer 

This application aims to show the step by step approach the various searching algorithms (Linear, binary, jump search etc.) take when applied on a list of elements 

## Demo 

<img src = "https://github.com/sameerad2001/3.-Search-Visualizer/blob/master/public/img/Demo.gif" alt = "Website Demo"/>

## How does it work 
1. Enter a sequence of keys separated by commas (Eg : "1,2,3,4")
2. Enter the key that needs to be searched 
3. Enter the time delay i.e the time gap between each step of the selected algorithm
4. Select a algorithm

5. The application will open a new page with the entered sequence, press start ....

## What works and what doesn't

Currently only 3 algorithms have been implemented those being :
1. Linear search
2. Binary search 
4. Jump search

I will try to work on the rest of the algorithms mentioned on the drop down list some time this year
